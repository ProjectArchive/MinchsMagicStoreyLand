The too doo list.
This should be handled as a queue of somesort, so we can organize what was done by who. An potential method of organization would be as follows:
[ItemDescription-Status-Who@DATE]. Status descriptions could be standardized and or customizable.
Enclosing items in square braces (or any other obvious deliniatiating character) will help keep this document clean and useful. No items should be deleted from this list, but merely
marked as DONE, the next entry would then follow below it. Having the oldest entry at the top seems illogical, but it will make Git happy, as otherwise, I fear we will create
consistent MERGE errors in git, as we will all be editing the same line consistently. The date stamp was entered using Gedit's insert date. It may be unnesecary, I would love some input as to other ways to do get a TODO list together thtat will work well. Another thought I had was using googledocs, a spreadsheet. However it could potentially provide one more resource we need to manage...I guess we can play around with it/someone can take lead and come up with a solution that works well :) (smiley faces are key.)
